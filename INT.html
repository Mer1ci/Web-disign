<h1> <font color="blue"><u>Life on Earth</u></font></h1>
<h1>The existence of diverse definitions of life, as detailed in the previous section, surely means that life is complex and difficult to briefly define. A scientific understanding of living systems has existed since the second half of the 19th century. But the diversity of definitions and lack of consensus among professionals suggest something else as well.</h1>

<h1>Life, living matter and, as such, matter that shows certain attributes that include responsiveness, growth, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction.</h1>
<h1> Life comprises individuals, living beings, assignable to groups (taxa). Each individual is composed of one or more minimal living units, called cells, and is capable of transformation of carbon-based and other compounds (metabolism), growth, and participation in reproductive acts.</h1>
<h1>As far as is known, life exists only on Earth. Most life-forms reside in a thin sphere that extends about 23 km (14 miles) from 3 km (2 miles) beneath the bottom of the ocean to the top of the troposphere (lower atmosphere); the relative thickness is comparable to a coat of paint on a rubber ball. An estimated 10â€“30 million distinguishable species currently inhabit this sphere of life, or biosphere.</h1>
